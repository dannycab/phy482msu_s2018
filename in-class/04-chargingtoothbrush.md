title: Charging a toothbrush
---

![toothbrush][toothbrush]

Electric toothbrushes are now charged without direct contact - using a technique called, "inductive charging." Your team will design a charging station that takes the 120V AC signal from the wall and converts it to the 12V 100mA AC signal needed to charge a toothbrush.

You may need to make some assumptions about how effective the inductive charging setup is. You will also need to ensure you have chosen the right resistive element(s) and explain why they are the correct choices.
