title: Magnetic field due to a charging capacitor
---

Consider an RC circuit where the capacitor is made from a set of parallel circular plates of radius $a$ and separation $d$. The circuit is connected to a battery of voltage $V_0$ by a switch. After the switch is thrown, determine the magnetic field that develops between the capacitor plates.
