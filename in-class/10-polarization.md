Up to now, we have worked with one-dimensional sinusoidal traveling waves $$f(z,t) = \tilde{A}e^{i(kz-\omega t)}.$$ that satisfy the 1D wave equation,

$$\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2} = \dfrac{1}{v^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}.$$

We have also shown that sinusoidal traveling waves that propogate in 3D satisfy the wave equation,

$$f(\mathbf{r},t) = \tilde{A}e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)}.$$
