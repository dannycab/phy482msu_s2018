### Computational Homework problems

* We will be using Python on homework problems this semester.
* Installation instructions appear on the piazza site.
* Homework solutions should take the form of a Jupyter notebook, which you can print to PDF and turn in.
* If you get stuck somewhere, post on piazza, so your classmates benefit from your question.

## What do you think PHY 482 is about?

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Electromagnetism is the foundational field theory of physics

Think about everything you already know about electromagnetism (it's a lot already!).

Work with a partner to map out the electromagnetism concepts that you know and how they are related to each other.
